Predict the weather based on LSTM 
The project addresses the issue of weather nowcasting using deep learning methods. Our specific goal was to predict the weather for the next three hours based on data from the last 48 hours and classify it into three categories of Clear, Cloudy, and Rain. We trained multiple LSTMs with various structures to fulfill this task.
